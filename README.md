## Description

The Rogue-like LibGDX project is an engaging Rogue-like game developed with LibGDX, where the game map is dynamically generated using procedural methods, providing an infinite and ever-evolving gaming experience.

### Key Features

- Procedural Level Generation: The game intelligently generates levels based on the player's progress, ensuring a unique and challenging environment in each playthrough.

- Diverse Items: Encounter a variety of items, including weapons, powers, and healing items, each with a percentage-based drop rate. The dynamic loot system adds an element of unpredictability to the gameplay.
